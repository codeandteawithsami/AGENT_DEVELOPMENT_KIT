## What are Callbacks in ADK?

Callbacks are functions that execute at specific points in an agents's execution flow.

They allow you to:

1. **Monitor and Logo**: Track agent activity and performace metrics
2. **Filter Content**:  Block inappropriate requests or responses
3. **Transform Data**: Modify inputs and outputs in the agent workflow
4. **Implement Security Policies**: Enforce compliance and safety measures
5. **Add Custom Logics**: Insert business-specific processing into the agent flow

ADK provides several types of callbacks that can be attached to different components of your agent system.
